### Fifa is one of the most played console games in the world. FIFA 19 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts as part of the FIFA series. It is the 28th installment in the FIFA series, and was released on 9 October 2020 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Enhanced versions for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S, in addition to a version for Stadia. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis using the FIFA 21 data set. Later, I made visualizations using matplotlib & seaborn libraries.
